/*Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.

Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.*/

//Logic: Just divide by 2, 3 and 5 as often as possible and then check whether we arrived at 1. 
//Also try divisor 4 if that makes the code simpler / less repetitive.

    public boolean isUgly(int num) {
        for(int i=2; i<6 && num>0; i++){
            while(num%i==0)
                num = num/i;
